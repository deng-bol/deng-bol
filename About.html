	<h1>RESILENCE ACTION INTERNATIONAL</h1>

	<p>Resilience Action International ( RAI ) is a dynamic refugee-led non-governmental organization hheadquartered in Kakuma Refugee Camp. Founded in 2019, Resilience Action International began as a refugee self-help group called Solidarity and Advocacy with vunerable Individuals in Crisis (SAVIC) with a missioion to bridge the language gap to employment opportunities for non-English speaking refugees. Over the years, our dedication to empowering communities has driven our transformation from a community-based organization in 2014 to an NGO in 2016.</p>
	<p>Today, RAI stands as a leading refugee-led organization in kakuma, focusing on empowering refugee youth in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) for 2030. RAI's work primarily contributes to targets related to Quality Education, Gender Equality, Decent work and Economic Growth, and Reduced Inequalities.</p>
